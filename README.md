# AngularJs - Assignment 1: Lunch-Checker
<hr>
<pre>
As a part of this project, we are supposed to build an application that contains:
    <bold>a)</bold>A text-box where user enters food items e.g -1,2,3 etc. <br>
    <bold>b)</bold>Then, the user clicks "Check if Too Much" button.<br>
    <bold>c)</bold>Process that input data then display the messages accordingly.<br>
</pre>

Once the user clicks the button, the input validation takes place. The items separated by comma "," is separated and processed. If the user does not enter any item i.e only white space is present, then we do not consider that item and proceed to check another item. If the number of items is less than 3, the user can see <strong>"Enjoy!"</strong> message. If the number of items is more than 3, then the user gets <strong>"Too Much!"</strong> message. However, if the user does not enter any item, then he gets <strong>"Please enter data first"</strong> message in the screen.
